***How to instantiate an AData class.

AData data = new ADate(new File("plugins" + File.separator + "EG"));

***AData can even create the file for you, it will automatically check if it already exists or not.

data.createNewFile();

**Adding Data
AData supports all standard data types : Strings, ints, doubles etc. Do not try and parse arrays and arraylists unless you have formatted them into a single String. I plan to add support for these later.

AData also supports Bukkit Location data types and I am looking to add more support for Bukkit data types.
To save location data you need to create a LocationData() object. This is very simple, all you have to do is :

Location l = yourlocation;
LocationData lData = new LocationData(l);

**You can then add this location to the data to be written to the file by the addData(String key, Object value) method.

data.addData("MyLocation", lData);

**In Addition to this AData also supports comments and forced line breaks. Furthermore it stores your keys in a linked HashMap so your data will be written out in the order you put it in! Useless if you have a big config and want to order it alphabetically.

data.addComment("MyComment");

data.addNewLine();

**Then to write the data to the file simply call the writeData() method.

data.writeData();

**Similary data can be read easily. Using the AData class we created above you first need to load the data into memory by readData();

data.readData();

**You can then grab your locations, ints, Strings and what not as if you were using Bukkits Configuration file.

data.getObject("MyObject");
data.getString("YourKey");
data.getInt("MyInt");
data.getDouble("MyDouble);
data.getLocation("MyLocation");
